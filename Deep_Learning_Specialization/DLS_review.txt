1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
    1.1 Introduction
        1.1.1 What is neural networks?
        1.1.2 Supervised Learning, Structure Data / Unstructured Data
        1.1.3 Why is deep learning taking off?
    1.2 Basics of Neural Network programming 
        1.2.1 Logistic Regression as a Neural Network
            1.2.1.1 Binary Classification
            1.2.1.2 Logistic Regression, Given x → y^ = P(y = 1 | x)
            1.2.1.3 Logistic Regression cost function, 
                - The loss function, a single training error
                - The cost function, the average of the loss functions of the entire training set.
            1.2.1.4 Gradient Descent
                - Minimize the cost function J(w, b) by updating w, b
                - w := w - α * δJ(w, b)/δw, b := b - δJ(w, b)/δb (δ for more than one variables' derivative)
            1.2.1.5 Computation Graph, forward propagation, backward propagation
            1.2.1.6 Logistic Regression Gradient Descent
        1.2.2 Python and Vectorization
            - Vectorization is used for making efficient code for training deep learning by minimizing for loop.
