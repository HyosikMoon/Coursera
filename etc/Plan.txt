==================

- Understanding and Optimization of reinforcement learning
- 1. Understand the models
- 2. Define main problems in RL
    - Mechanism ?
    - Inefficient, require a lot of data and time to train
    - Vulnerable to the slight change of the environments
- 3. Approaches to solve the problems
- 4. My own solutions
    - Scalable approach RL ?
    - Meta-learning & RL ?
- 5. Plans















1. Understanding algorithms (~ 0.5 years)
    - See, Hear, Speak → Recognize task
    - Learn Task (Reinforcement learning)

2. Improvement, Optimization (0.5 years ~)
    2.1) Few data → Efficient algorithm
        2.1.1) Preprocess data in various ways (angle, size, light and shade, perspective(distance), etc) artificially → Train models → Find factors (Casuality)
        2.1.2) With the factors → Train a new model with weights those factors (angle, size, light, etc) → Without the preprocessed data the model can learn more accurately
    2.2) Overfitting
        2.2.1) Esemble methods
            2.2.1.1) Dropout neurons
            2.2.1.2) Dropout layers ✔
        2.2.2) Weight Regularization

        2.2.3) Compare overfitted neural networks and the right one to find out the factors
            - Is there a way to train the model without dropout neurons but with the inner characteristics such as prohibiting fators that leads to overfitting

3. Generalization of neural networks (1.5 years ~ )
    3.1) Generalization to higher domains (ex. dogs → four lags animals, cars → vehicles, etc.)
        3.1.1) Capsule Learning
            - Recognize and are categorized into higher level of concepts
    3.2) Generalization among different domains (ex. multimodal deep learning, system II AI?)
        3.2.1) Computer vision (Seeing) ↔ Natural Language Processing (Listening, Speaking)
        3.2.2) Computer vision & Natural Language Processing ↔ Reinforcement Leraning ✔
    3.3) Generalization of algorithms
        - Understanding of learning mechanisms for reward maximization
        - Reinforcement learning systems that can generalize their learning across several domains
        3.3.1) Algorithms that change rewards depending on the situations and environments in real time and its impact to the learning result
        3.3.2) Negative rewards learning and learning modification i.e., learning what shouldn't do and wrong behaviours 

4. Human-level AI (Algorithms to learn general intelligence)
    4-1) What to learn?
        4-1-1) Algorithms that define problems and learn (Meta learning, Learning to learn)
