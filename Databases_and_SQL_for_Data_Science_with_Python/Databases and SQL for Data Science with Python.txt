1. Basic SQL
    1.1 Learning purpose
        - Basics of SQL, Relational Database Model
        - SQL, data, database, relational database
    1.2 Basic terms
        1.2.1 SQL (Structured Query Language): A language used for relational databses
        1.2.2 data: Facts (words, numbers), Pictures
        1.2.3 database: A repository of data, Provides the functionality for adding, modifying and querying that data
        1.2.4 Relational Databse: Data stored in tabular form (columns and rows)
        1.2.5 Database: repository of data
        1.2.6 DBMS (Database Management System): software to manage databases
        1.2.7 RDBMS (Relational database management system): A set of software tools that controls the data (access, organization, and storage)
    1.3 Basic SQL commands
        - Create a table, Insert, Select, Update, Delete
        1.3.1 SELECT
            - The general syntax of SELECT statments is: select COLUMN1, COLUMN2, ... from TABLE1 ;
            - To retrieve all columns from the COUNTRY table we could use "*" instead of specifying individual column names: select * from COUNTRY ;
            - The WHERE clause can be added to your query to filter results or get specific rows of data. 
            - To retrieve data for all rows in the COUNTRY table where the ID is less than 5: select * from COUNTRY where ID < 5 ;
            - In case of character based columns the values of the predicates in the where clause need to be enclosed in single quotes. 
            - To retrieve the data for the country with country code "CA" we would issue: select * from COUNTRY where CCODE = 'CA';
            1.3.1.1 Select statement with COUNT
                - COUNT() is a built-in function that retrieves the number of rows matching the query criteria
                - ex. select COUNT(*) from tablename
                - ex. select COUNT(COUNTRY) from MEDALS where COUNTRY='CANADA'
            1.3.1.2 Select statement with DISTINCT
                - DISTINCT is used to remove duplicate values from a result set
                - ex. select DISTINCT columnname from tablename
                - ex. select DISTINCT COUNTRY from MEDALS where MEDALTYPE = 'GOLD'
            1.3.1.3 Select statement with LIMIT
                - LIMIT is used for restricting the number of rows retrieved from the database
                - ex. select * from tablename LIMIT 10
                - ex. select * from MEDALS where YEAR = 2018 LIMIT 5
         1.3.2 INSERT
             - A Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement used to read and modify data
             - The general syntax of INSERT statement is: INSERT INTO [TableName] <([ColumnName], ...)> VALUES ([Value], ...)
             - ex. INSERT INTO AUTHOR (AUTHOR_ID, LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, EMAIL, CITY, COUNTRY) VALUES ('A1', 'Chong', 'Raul', 'rfc@ibm.com', 'Toronto', 'CA')
         1.3.3 UPDATE
             - A Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement used to read and modify data
             - The general syntax of UPDATE statement is: UPDATE [TableName] SET [[ColumnName]=[Value]] <WHERE [Condition]>
             - ex. UPDATE AUTHOR SET LASTNAME='KATTA' FIRSTNAME='LAKSHMI' WHERE AUTHOR_ID='A2'
         1.3.4 DELETE
             - A Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement used to read and modify data
             - The general syntax of DELETE statement is: DELETE [TableName] SET [[ColumnName]=[Value]] <WHERE [Condition]>
             - ex. DELETE FROM AUTHOR WHERE AUTHOR_ID IN ('A2','A3')

2. Relational Database Concepts
    2.1 What is relational database
        - Relational database is tables consisting of entities
        - Entities are independent objects which have attributes
        - The key advantage of the relational model is data independence
    2.2 Databse instance on Cloud
        2.2.1 Characteristics of Cloud databses
            - Eaas of Use and Access, ex. API, Web Interface, Cloud or Remote Application

        2.2.2 Examples of Cloud databases
            - IBM Db2, Databases for PostgreSQL, Oracle Database Cloud Service, Microsoft Azure SQL Database, Amazon Relational Database Services (RDS)
        2.2.3 Database service instances
            - DBaaS (Database-as-a-Service) provides users with access to Database resources in cloud without setting up hardware and installing software
            - Database service instance holds data in data objects/tables
            - Once data is loaded, it can be queried using web interfaces and applications
    2.3 Tpyes for SQL statements (DDL vs DML)
        2.3.1 DDL (Data Definition Langugae) statements
            - Define, change, or drop data, ex. CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE, DROP
        2.3.2 DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements:
            - Read and modify data, CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete rows)
            - Common DML, ex. INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE

3. Using String Patterns and Ranges
    3.1 Retrieving rows
        - select * from table_name (Retrieve all rows of the table)
        3.1.1 Using Strings: select column_name from table_name where condition 
            - the WHERE clause to refine your query results
            - ex. select book_id, title from Book WHERE book_id='B1'
            - the wildcard character (%) as a substitute for unknown characters in a pattern
            - ex. select firstname from Author WHERE firstname like 'R%'
        3.1.2 Using Ranges: select column_name from table_name where condition
            - ex. select title, pages from Book WHERE pages >= 290 AND pages <= 300
            - BETWEEN ... AND ... to specify a range of numbers
            - ex. select title, pages from Book WHERE pages between 290 and <= 300
        3.1.3 Using Set of values: select column_name from table_name where condition
            - ex. select firstname, lastname, country from Author WHERE country='AU' OR country='BR'
            - ex. select firstname, lastname, country from Author WHERE country IN ('AU', 'BR')
    3.2 Sorting Results Sets
        - sort query results into ascending or descending order, using the ORDER BY clause to specify the column to sort on
        3.2.1 Ascending order (default): select column_name from table_name ORDER BY column_name
            - ex. select title from Book ORDER BY title
        3.2.2 Descending order: select column_name from table_name ORDER BY column_name DESC
            - ex. select title from Book ORDER BY title DESC
        3.2.3 Order by column number: select column_name from table_name ORDER BY column_number
            - ex. select title from Book ORDER BY 2
    3.3 Grouping Result Sets
        3.3.1 Eliminating duplicates: select distinct(column_name) from table_name
            - ex. select distinct(country) from Author
        3.3.2 Eliminate duplicates and count: select column_name count(column_name) as Count from table_name GROUP BY column_name
            - group query results by using the GROUP BY clause
            - count() is function, as Count is a column name for count() result
            - ex. select country, count(country) as Count from Author group by country
        3.3.3 +Having clause: select column_name count(column_name) as Count from table_name group by column_name having count(column_name) > count_number
            - ex. select country, count(country) as Count from Author group by country having count(country) > 4

4. Accessing Databases using Python
    4.1 How to Access Databases Using Python
        - Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, SciPy
        - Python connects to the database using API calls 
        - User ⇔ Jupytor Notebook (w/ Python programs) ⇔ API calls (SQL APIs and Python DB APIs) ⇔ DBMS
        - Database ⇔ SQL API: ex. MySQL ⇔ MySQL C API, PostgreSQL ⇔ psycopg2, IBM DB2 ⇔ ibm_db, SQL Server ⇔ dblib API, 
                                             Oracle ⇔ OCI, Microsoft Windows OS ⇔ OBDC, Oracle ⇔ OCI, Java ⇔ JDBC, MongoDB ⇔ PyMongo
    4.2 Writing code using DB-API
        4.2.1 Concepts of the Python DB API
            - My Application ⇔ Open, Execute, Fetchall, close ⇔ Cursor object ⇔ Connection object ⇔ Database
            - DB-API is Python's standard API for accessing relational databases
            - It allows you to write a single program that works with multiple kinds of relational databases instead of writing a separate program for each one
            - The DB_API  connect constructor creates a connection to the database and returns a Connection Object, 
              which is then used by the various connection methods
            4.2.1.1 Connection Object
                - Database connections, Manage transactions
                - ex. .cursor(), .commit(), .rollback(), .close()
                - The cursor() method, which returns a new cursor object using the connection.
                - The commit() method, which is used to commit any pending transaction to the database.
                - The rollback() method, which causes the database to roll-back to the start of any pending transaction.
                - The close() method, which is used to close a database connection. 
            4.2.1.2 Cursor Objects
                - Databse Queries, Scroll through result set, Retrieve results
                - ex. .callproc(), .execute(), .executemany(), .fetchone(), .fetchmany(), .fetchall(), .nextset(), .arraysize(), .close()
            4.2.1.3 Writing code using DB-API
                - from dbmodule import connect
                4.2.1.3.1 Create connection object
                    - Connection = connect('databasename', 'username', 'pswd')
                4.2.1.3.2 Create a cursor object
                    - Cursor = connection.cursor()
                4.2.1.3.3 Run Queries
                    - Cursor.execute('select * from mytable')
                    - Results = cursor.fetchall()
                4.2.1.3.4 Free resources
                    - Cursor.close()
                    - Connection.close()
    4.3 Connecting to a database using ibm_db API
        - ex. import ibm_db
               dsn_driver = "{IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER}"
               dsn_database = "BLUDB"
               dsn_hostname = "MyDb2Hostname"
               dsn_port = "50000"
               dsn_protocol = "TCPIP"
               # Create databsae connection
               dsn = (  "DRIVER={{IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER}};"  
                           "DATABASE={0};"  "HOSTNAME={1};"  
                           "PORT={2};"  
                           "PROTOCOL=TCPIP;"  
                           "UID={3};"  "PWD={4};"  ).format(dsn_database, dsn_hostname, dsn_port, dsn_uid, dsn_pwd)
               conn = ibm_db.connect(dsn, "", "")
    4.4 Creating tables, loading data and querying data
        4.4.1 Connect to the database (Refer 4.3)
        4.4.2 Create tables: ex. ibm_db.exec_immediate()
            - Three parameters: Connection, Statement, Options
            - ex. stmt = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, "CREATE TABLE Trucks(serial_no varchar(20) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, model VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, 
                             Engine_size VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, Truck_Class VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL)"
        4.4.3 Python code to Query data 
            - ex. stmt = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, "SELECT * FROM Trucks")
                   imb_db.fetch_both(stmt)
        4.4.4 Using pandas to Query data
            - ex. import pandas
                   import ibm_db_dbi
                   pconn = ibm_db_dbi.Connection(conn)
                   df = pandas.real_sql('SELECT * FROM Trucks', pconn)
    4.5 Analyzing data with Python
        4.5.1 Verify Loaded Data Using SQL 
            - stmt = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, "SELECT * FROM MCDONALDS_NUTRITION")
              imb_db.fetch_both(stmt)
        4.5.2 Using pandas
            - ex. import pandas
                   import ibm_db_dbi
                   pconn = ibm_db_dbi.Connection(conn)
                   df = pandas.real_sql('SELECT * FROMMCDONALDS_NUTRITION', pconn)
                   df.head()   # read first five rows of the df
            4.5.2.1 Learn about data
                - df.describe(include='all')  # Describe statistical and mathematical information about the summary of df

               - step2. find the index of the value
                     - ex. df["Sodium"].idxmax()
                            (Output) 82
               - step3. find the item with the index
                     - ex. df.at[82, "Item"]
                            (Output) 'Chicken McNuggets (40 piece)'

5. Working with Real World Datasets
    5.1 Working with CSV files
        - Many real data sets are .CSV files
        - .CSV: COMMA SEPERATED VALUES
        5.1.1 Querying column names with mixed (upper and lower) case
            - Use double quotes to specify mixed-case column names
            - ex. select "Id" from DOGS
        5.1.2 Querying column names with spaces and special characters
            - By default, spaces and special characters are mapped to underscores
            - select "Id", "Name_of_Dog", "Breed__dominant_breed_if_not_pure_breed_"
                                                ⇔ "Breed (dominant breed if not pure breed)"
        5.1.2 Using quotes in Jupyter notebooks
            5.4.1 FIrst assign queries to variables: ex. selectQuery = 'select "Id" from dogs'
            5.4.2 Use a backslash \ as the excape character in cases where the query contains single quotes
                - ex. selectQuery = 'select * from dogs where "Name_of_Dog"=\`Huggy\` `
        5.1.3 Splitting queries to multiple lines in Jupyter
            5.1.3.1 Use backslash "\" to split the query into mutiple lines
                - ex. %sql select "Id", "Name_of_Dog", \
                             from dogs \
                             where "Name_of_Dog"='Huggy'
            5.1.3.2 Or use %%sql in the first row of the cell in the notebook
                - ex. %%sql 
                       select "Id", "Name_of_Dog", 
                             from dogs 
                             where "Name_of_Dog"='Huggy'
        5.1.4 Restricting the # of rows retrieved
            - To get a sample or look at a small set of rows, limit the result set by using the LIMIT clause
            - ex. select * from census_data LIMIT 3
    5.2 Getting Table and Column Details
        5.2.1 Getting a list of tables in the database
            - DB2 ⇔ SYSCAT.TABLES,  SQL Server ⇔ INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES,  Oracle ⇔ ALL_TABLES or USER_TABLES
            - ex. select * from syscat.tables
            - ex. select TABSCHEMA, TABNAME, CREATE_TIME from syscat.tables where tabschema='Db2 unser_name'
        5.2.2 Getting a list of columns in the database
            - ex. select * from syscat.columns where tabname='DOGS'
            - ex. select distinct(name), coltype, length from sysibm.syscolumns where tbname='DOGS'
