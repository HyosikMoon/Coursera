Python for Data Science, AI & Development

1. Basics
    1.1 Types: int, float, String, List, Dictionary, Bool
    1.2 Expressions and Variables
    1.3 String Operations

2. Data Structures
    2.1 Lists and Tuples
    2.2 Dictionaries
        - {"key":1, "key2":"2", "key3":[3,3,3], "key4":(4,4,4), ... }
        - keys(), values()
    2.3 Sets
        - {"elem1", "elem2", ... }
        - has an unique element
        - add(), remove(), &, issubset()

3. Programming Fundamentals
    3.1 Conditions and Branching
        3.1 Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, =<, =>
        3.2 Branching: if else statement
        3.3 Logic Operators: or, and 
    3.2 Loops
        3.2.1 for loops
        3.2.2 while loops
    3.3 Functions
        3.3.1 def 
        3.3.2 len()
        3.3.3 sum()
        3.3.4 sorted(), sort()
        3.3.5 scope (global, local)
    3.4 Exception Handling
        3.4.1 try ... except ... else ... finally
    3.5 Objects and Classes
        3.5.1 Object
            - an object is an instance of a particular type
            - every object has a type, an internal representation, a set of procedures for interacting the object (methods)
        3.5.2 Methods
            - A class or type's methods are functions that every instance of that class or type provides
            - It's how you interact with the data in an object, ex. sort(), reverse()
        3.5.3 Class
            - Attributes, Methods
